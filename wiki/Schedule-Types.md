## 3-Nap Schedule (4-6 months)

### Overview

Youngest babies need three naps to stay well-rested without becoming overtired.

### Wake Windows

| Window | Min | Max | Description |
|--------|-----|-----|-------------|
| Wake → Nap 1 | 1.5h | 2h | Shortest window |
| Nap 1 → Nap 2 | 2h | 2.5h | Mid-morning |
| Nap 2 → Nap 3 | 2h | 2.5h | Afternoon |
| Nap 3 → Bedtime | 2h | 2.5h | Short to bed |

### Sample Schedule

```
6:30 AM  - Wake
8:00 AM  - Nap 1 (1-1.5h)
9:30 AM  - Wake
11:30 AM - Nap 2 (1-1.5h)
1:00 PM  - Wake
3:30 PM  - Nap 3 (30-45 min)
4:15 PM  - Wake
6:30 PM  - Bedtime
```

### Key Points

- Third nap is often the "cat nap" (short)

- Total day sleep: 4-5 hours

### Signs Baby Is Ready for 2-Nap

## 2-Nap Schedule (6-15 months)

### Overview

The most common schedule for babies, with two solid naps during the day.

### Wake Windows

| Window | Min | Max | Description |
|--------|-----|-----|-------------|
| Wake → Nap 1 | 2h | 2.5h | Morning tolerance |
| Nap 1 → Nap 2 | 2.5h | 3.5h | Longest stretch |
| Nap 2 → Bedtime | 3.5h | 4.5h | Builds sleep pressure |

### Sample Schedule

```
6:30 AM  - Wake
8:45 AM  - Nap 1 (1.5-2h)
10:30 AM - Wake
1:00 PM  - Nap 2 (1.5-2h)
3:00 PM  - Wake
7:00 PM  - Bedtime
```

### Nap Configuration

**Nap 1:**
| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Earliest Start | 8:30 AM |
| Latest Start | 9:00 AM |
| Max Duration | 2 hours |
| End By | 11:00 AM |

**Nap 2:**
| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Earliest Start | 12:00 PM |
| Latest Start | 1:00 PM |
| Max Duration | 2 hours |
| End By | 3:00 PM |

### Key Points

- Both naps should be in the crib
- Day sleep cap: 3-3.5 hours
- Nap 1 tends to be easier to get
- Nap 2 often shorter or harder
- Bedtime typically 7:00-7:30 PM

### Handling Nap Variations

**If Nap 1 is long (2h+):**
- Wake baby by end time (11:00 AM)
- Nap 2 may be shorter
- That's okay - bedtime adjusts

**If Nap 1 is short (<1h):**
- May need emergency nap 2 earlier
- Nap 2 cap can extend to 2.5h
- Move bedtime earlier

**If Nap 2 is skipped:**
- Emergency early bedtime (5:30-6:00 PM)
- Don't add a third nap
- Reset the next day

## Transition Schedule (14-18 months)

### Overview

Special schedule for transitioning from 2 naps to 1 nap over 4-6 weeks.

### How It Works

1. **Weeks 1-2**: Single nap at 11:30 AM
2. **Every 5-7 days**: Push nap 15 minutes later
3. **Goal**: Single nap at 12:30 PM

### Wake Windows During Transition

| Window | Early Transition | Late Transition |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|
| Wake → Nap | 5h | 5.5h |
| Nap → Bedtime | 4h | 4.5h |

### Temporary Allowances

- Earlier wake time allowed (up to 8:00 AM)
- Extended day sleep cap (up to 3 hours)
- Very early bedtimes okay (5:30-6:00 PM)

### Key Points

- Expect some difficult days
- Earlier bedtimes are normal
- Use 90-minute crib rule
- Commit to the full transition

See [Nap Transition](Nap-Transition) for detailed guidance.

## Customizing Schedules

### Adjustable Settings

All these can be customized in DreamTime:
