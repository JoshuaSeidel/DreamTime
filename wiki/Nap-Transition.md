# 2-to-1 Nap Transition

A comprehensive guide to transitioning your baby from two naps to one nap per day.

## Overview

The 2-to-1 nap transition is one of the biggest sleep changes for babies, typically occurring between 14-18 months. DreamTime provides guided support for this 4-6 week transition.

---

## When to Transition

### Typical Age Range

| Age | Recommendation |
|-----|----------------|
| Under 13 months | Too early - keep 2 naps |
| 13-14 months | Watch for readiness signs |
| 14-18 months | Most common transition window |
| 18+ months | Likely ready if not transitioned |

### Readiness Signs

Your baby may be ready when showing **3 or more** of these signs for **2+ weeks**:

| Sign | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Nap 2 resistance** | Takes 20+ minutes to fall asleep for nap 2 |
| **Skipping nap 2** | Plays or fusses for entire nap 2 attempt |
| **Short nap 2** | Consistently under 30 minutes |
| **Night wake increase** | New night wakings or early morning wakes |
| **Nap 1 getting longer** | Nap 1 extending to 2+ hours naturally |
| **Happy until late morning** | No sleepy cues until 10:30 AM or later |

### Not Ready Yet

Don't transition if:
- Baby still takes both naps easily most days
- Skipping nap 2 causes major overtiredness
- Baby is under 13 months
- Sleep is disrupted by illness, teething, or travel

### Special Recommendations

During transition, recommendations account for:

- **Earlier bedtimes**: App suggests 6:00-6:30 PM bedtime if needed
- **90-minute crib rule**: Extended minimum crib time
- **Wake window flexibility**: Allows longer morning wake window
- **Nap cap adjustment**: Allows up to 3 hours for single nap

## Adjusting the Pace

### When to Slow Down

Slow down if baby shows:
- Increased night wakings
- Early morning wakes (before 6 AM)
- Meltdowns before nap time
- Falling asleep before target time consistently

### How to Slow Down

1. Go to **Schedule** > **Nap Transition**
2. Tap **Adjust Pace**
3. Increase "Days Between Pushes" (e.g., 5 → 7)
4. Or tap "Pause for a Week" to hold current time

### When to Speed Up

Speed up if baby shows:
- Easy settling at current nap time
- Happy mood all morning
- Sleeping well at night
- Naturally staying awake past target

### How to Speed Up

1. Go to **Schedule** > **Nap Transition**
2. Tap **Adjust Pace**
3. Decrease "Days Between Pushes" (e.g., 7 → 4)
4. Or tap "Push Now" to advance immediately

## Handling Difficult Days

### The "Rescue Nap"

Sometimes baby needs an emergency nap to prevent severe overtiredness.

**When to Use:**
- Baby is melting down before 10:30 AM
- Overnight sleep was significantly disrupted
- Baby is sick or teething

**How to Handle:**

1. Offer a short nap (20-30 minutes max)
2. Log it as an "Ad-Hoc Nap" in DreamTime
3. Still attempt the scheduled nap later
4. Accept an earlier bedtime

### Logging Rescue Naps

```

### Avoiding Rescue Naps

- Don't drive during morning wake window
- Avoid stroller walks close to old nap times
- Keep mornings active and stimulating
- Offer snacks to bridge hunger-tiredness

## Bedtime During Transition

### Expect Earlier Bedtimes

| Transition Week | Typical Bedtime |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Week 1-2 | 6:00-6:30 PM |
| Week 3-4 | 6:30-7:00 PM |
| Week 5-6 | 6:45-7:15 PM |
| Post-transition | 7:00-7:30 PM |

### Why Earlier Bedtimes Help

- Prevents overtiredness
- Protects night sleep quality
- Gives baby time to adjust
- Reduces bedtime battles

### DreamTime Bedtime Adjustments

The app automatically:
- Calculates sleep debt from missed nap 2
- Suggests earlier bedtime based on single nap
- Alerts you if bedtime is getting too late
- Tracks night sleep to ensure adequate rest

## Common Challenges

### Challenge: Baby Falls Asleep Before Target

**Problem:** Baby keeps falling asleep at 11:00 AM instead of 11:30 AM

**Solutions:**
1. Keep mornings very active (outdoor play, new toys)
2. Offer a snack around 10:30 AM
3. Avoid car/stroller during danger zone
4. Use bright lights and stimulation

### Challenge: Baby Won't Sleep at New Time

**Problem:** Baby is awake and playing at 11:30 AM nap attempt

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure wake window is adequate (5-5.5 hours minimum)
2. Keep pre-nap routine consistent
3. Use the 90-minute crib rule - stay in crib
4. Check that room is dark enough

### Challenge: Nap Is Too Short

**Problem:** Baby only sleeps 45 minutes for single nap

**Solutions:**
1. Use the 90-minute crib rule - leave baby in crib
2. Check room environment (dark, white noise)
3. Ensure adequate wake window before nap
4. May need to temporarily use earlier bedtime

### Challenge: Night Sleep Disrupted

**Problem:** Baby waking more at night since starting transition

**Solutions:**
1. Move bedtime earlier
2. Slow down the transition pace
3. Ensure single nap is long enough (ideally 2+ hours)
4. Check that total 24-hour sleep is adequate

## FAQ

### Can I go back to 2 naps if it's not working?

Yes, but try to commit for at least 2 weeks first. Some regression is normal. If after 2 weeks baby is significantly worse, you may have started too early.

### What if we're traveling during transition?

Pause the transition (freeze at current nap time) and resume when home. Travel disrupts sleep anyway, so don't add transition stress.

### My baby naps 3 hours - should I wake them?

During transition, allow up to 3 hours. After transition is complete, cap at 2-2.5 hours to protect night sleep.

### When does the day sleep cap change?

- During transition: 3 hours allowed
- 4-6 weeks post-transition: Reduce to 2.5 hours
- Established 1-nap schedule: 2-2.5 hours
